I started my career in tax accounting. My accounting firm provided services for a variety of clients, so I had exposure to many industries. Each client has different data. I quickly learned how frustrating raw financial data could be to deal with. In college I considered an MIS major, but eventually decided to pursue the more secure and structured field of accounting. In working with so much financial data, however, I found that I could leverage my MIS background as well. I invested time into learning very basic VBA, enough so that I could look up and manipulate code for my own projects. I really enjoyed contributing efficiency.

I left public accounting in 2017 after feeling burnt out, and started the next chapter of my career at a multinational power management company. I was excited to begin specializing in International Tax, the sexy tax. I quickly became disillusioned in early 2018 when the U.S. passed sweeping tax reform. Not only did my workload increase, I got increasingly frustrated at how inefficient processes were, specifically gathering and manipulating data. From various acquisitions, my company had many legacy systems and financial data was split between SAP and Oracle. One of the biggest projects I worked on was recalculating depreciation for fixed assets. It took a couple weeks just to get all the data, and another couple months to recalculate everything in excel. Despite writing some macros that cut down some time, the project was incredibly time consuming. I just kept thinking, "There's got to be a better way."

When one of my friends mentioned she was looking into data science boot camp as a new career path, I was immediately intrigued. It helps when you are running on fumes from your current job. After doing some research, I felt like data science was something that just fit me. I didn't want data process improvement to be some lofty goal, but a career. I had gone down the path of secure and stable. It was time for something new and exciting. It's probably the millenial in me, but I did not feel deterred quitting without another job lined up. It just means I am willing to stake my career on something I really believe in and have a passion for.
