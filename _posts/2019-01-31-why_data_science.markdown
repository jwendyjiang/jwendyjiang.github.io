I started my career in tax accounting at EY. It's definitely not the most exciting introduction to tell someone you're an accountant, but I found many parts of my job to be exciting. From the beginning I was exposed to various industries and data types.  I quickly realized how frustrating raw financial data was to deal with. I got to interact with several clients along the way, and can confirm: they know when they are giving you subpar data. In college I had considered majoring in MIS, but eventually decided to pursue the more secure and structured field of accounting. In working with so much financial data, however, I found that I could leverage my MIS background. I invested time into learning basic VBA, enough so I could look up and manipulate code for my own projects. Eventually, I even began to write some of my own code to automate certain repetitive tasks. 

I left public accounting in 2017 after feeling burnt, and started the next chapter of my career at a multinational power management company. I was excited to begin specializing in International Tax, which many consider sexy in name and nature. Shortly after starting my new job, the U.S. passed sweeping tax reform. A large focus of the reform was on multinational corporations to try and repatriate all the offshore income. Not only did my workload increase, I got increasingly frustrated at how time consuming processes were, specifically gathering and manipulating data.

Due to various acquisitions, my company worked in several legacy systems and financial data was split between SAP and Oracle. One of the big projects I was working on was recalculating depreciation for fixed assets. It took a couple weeks just to get all the data, and another couple months to calculate everything in excel. Despite writing macros that cut down some time, the project still felt overly complicated and frustrating at every step. I just kept thinking, "There's got to be a better way." 

I was still continuing to grow disillusioned by my job, when one of my friends mentioned she was looking into data science as a new career path. I was immediately intrigued. It helps when you are running on fumes from your current job. After doing some research, I felt like data science was something that just fit me. I had always been more interested in the data side of tax. I want to feel valued when I contribute to data process improvement. I had gone down the path of secure and stable. It's time for something that sparks passion (and yes, joy) despite the uncertainty.
